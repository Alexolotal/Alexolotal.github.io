  <p> ooh look, an xor key, encoded in utf-8! Begin key:<span style="color:red">super_secret_xor_key</span>:End key</p>
  <p> Now you need some ciphertext, perhaps there's something you could do with the image?</p>
</body>
<!-- pssst! something like cyberchef might be useful once you have the ciphertext! -->
<!-- also, have you heard of least significant bit steganography? a solver/decoder might help! -->
